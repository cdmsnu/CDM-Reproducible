# Meta analysis

### p-value meta analysis

Calculated p-values of various periods

- 1 year ~ 5 years
- 1 year ~ 10 years
- 1 year ~ End of the observation

cf) The reason why the start time point is 1 year is because of the induction period when defining the cohort.

### Bayesian hierarchical meta analysis

- 1 year ~ 5 years
- 1 year ~ 10 years
- 1 year ~ End of the observation
